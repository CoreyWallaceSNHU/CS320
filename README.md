**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
The simple solution to quality is testing. The aim is to demonstrate or refute that the code accomplishes what it is supposed to do and nothing else. This contributes to the popularity of independent testing teams.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
